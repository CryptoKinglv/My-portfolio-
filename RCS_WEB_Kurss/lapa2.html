                                    20 minutes is a period of time when the BTC transaction has to appear on the network (not to be confirmed, but to be created). So the person who is willing to buy BCN with BTC has to pay the invoice within 20 minutes. While making the order, please, be sure that your BTC wallet is in your hand and you’re able to make a payment within the deadline. Please notice that it’s quite important to send your BTC from the external wallet like Blockchain.info but not from the exchange platforms. Only sending BTC from the external client will allow your funds go to the memory pool immediately. In other cases, your BCN won’t be deposited and you’ll be refunded with BTC in 30 days manually.

                                    I’m here to tell you about the current development phase and deadlines. So, the current desktop software versions seem to be a bit out-of-date and contain some issues. That’s why on the 2018 roadmap we’ve said that some huge updates will happen, and it’s really the thing that the Dev team has to pay the most attention to. Stable software is key to the success of a certain project we have been developing, and we’re happy to announce that today we’re launching the 3rd Alpha build on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The previous builds were successfully tested among our secret group of community enthusiasts, most of the suggestions were implemented, so the 2nd Alpha has shown results which are quite successful. The thing is that most of the essential issues were fixed (missing transactions, long sync procedures, blockchain load error, etc.) and the Alpha version we have now seems to be quite stable, and there are only a few things to shape with the design.

                                    This past year has shown to be of huge and growing interest among the entire crypto community concerning ICOs, and that’s one of the key points about why Ethereum still rocks. According to the opinions of blockchain experts and our own specialistist, the amount of ICOs will more than likely be doubled by this time next year. Our main aim is to build and organize the infrastructure which will allow anyone to make their own tokens for their own needs. The main goals we plan to accomplish by the development of Bytecoin’s untraceable tokens are simplicity, convenience, and reliability. These three basic ideas, working together, will set the new standards of initializing and participation for the initial coin offering.
